The Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) is a developer-centric command-line interface (CLI) tool for creating Azure applications. The goals of the CLI are to:

- reduce the time required for a developer to be productive
- demonstrate opinionated best practices for Azure development
- help developers understand core Azure development constructs

To take full advantage of the CLI, code repositories need to conform to a well defined set of conventions that will be recognized by the tooling. Please checkout the [wiki](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/wiki) for more information and to get started. Use [discussions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/discussions) to participate in the conversation, ask questions, and see the latest announcements.
