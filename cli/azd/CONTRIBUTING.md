# Contributing to `azd`

## Prerequisites

`azd` is written in Golang and requires Go 1.19 or above:

- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/)

If you don't have a preferred editor for Go code, we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). We have a `settings.json` file checked in, so if you launch `code` from within `cli/azd` you should get our customizations.

It also requires the `az` CLI:

- [AZ CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/)

We have some additional linting tools that we run in CI, and you will want to be able to run locally:

- [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/#local-installation)

In order to run end-to-end tests and develop templates, you'll need the following dependencies:

Language tooling:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads)
- [DotNet CLI](https://get.dot.net)

Infrastructure-as-code providers:

- [Bicep CLI](https://aka.ms/bicep-install)
- [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) (if working on Terraform templates)

Docker:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/#download-and-install)

## Submitting A Change

We use a fork based workflow for `azd`. Here are simple steps:

1. Fork `azure/azure-dev` on GitHub.
2. Create a branch named `<some-description>` (e.g. `fix-123` for a bug fix or `add-deploy-command`) in your forked Git repository.
3. Push the branch to your fork on GitHub.
4. Open a pull request in GitHub.

Here is a more [in-depth guide to forks in GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).

As part of CI validation, we run a series of live tests which provision and deprovision Azure resources. For external contributors, these tests will not run automatically, but someone on the team will be able to run them for your PR on your behalf.

## Debugging

In VS Code you can create a launch.json that runs the tool with a specified set of arguments and in a specific folder, for example:

```json
{
    "name": "dev-azd (launch)",
    "type": "go",
    "request": "launch",
    "mode": "debug",
    "program": "${workspaceFolder}",
    "args": [
        "restore"
    ],
    "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
},
```

## Testing

We use `gotestsum`, which is a simple tool that wraps `go test` except with better formatting output. Install the tool by running `go install gotest.tools/gotestsum@latest`.

### Run all unit tests

`gotestsum -- -short ./...`

### Run all end-to-end tests

```bash
go build
gotestsum -- -timeout 20m -run Test_CLI ./...
```

This runs all end-to-end tests that run `azd` locally and deploy live resources. Run `go build`  first to ensure the integration tests target
the latest `azd` binary built.

### Run all tests (including end-to-end tests)

```bash
go build
gotestsum -- -timeout 20m ./...
```

### Run a specific test

`gotestsum -- -timeout 20m -run Test_CLI_RestoreCommand ./...`

This can be useful for running specific end-to-end tests that cover the relevant scenarios.

## Linting

Run `golangci-lint run ./...`

> On Windows you may need to add `C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin` to `%PATH%`

## Spell checking

1. Install [cspell](https://cspell.org/)
2. CD to /cli/azd
3. Run `cspell lint "**/*.go" --relative --config ./.vscode/cspell.yaml`

## Troubleshooting

### Access is denied

Windows Security may block execution of unsigned .exe files. This may happen when validating unsigned .exe files produced in a PR build.

```
> azd version
Access is denied.
>
```

To fix: 

1. Run `where azd` (cmd) or `(Get-Command azd).Source` (PowerShell) to get the command path
1. Click the Start button and type `Windows Security`, select and launch the "Windows Security" application
1. Select `Virus & threat protection` tab on the left side of the window
1. Click the `Manage settings` link under `Virus & threat protection settings`
1. Scroll down in the window to the `Exclusions` heading and click the `Add or remove exclusions link` 
1. Select `Add an exclusion` and add the path to the exe from step 1
