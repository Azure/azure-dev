## Building `azd`

Prerequisites:

- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) 1.23

Build:

```bash
cd cli/azd
go build
```

Run the newly produced `azd` or `azd.exe` binary:

- Unix-like systems: `./azd`
- Windows: `.\azd.exe`

Run tests:

```bash
go test ./... -short
```

Run tests (including end-to-end [functional][functional tests] tests)

```bash
go test ./...
```

Run cspell (install [cspell](https://cspell.org/)):

```bash
`cspell lint "**/*.go" --relative --config ./.vscode/cspell.yaml`
```

Run linter (install [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/welcome/install/#local-installation)):

```bash
golangci-lint run ./...
```

> Note: On Windows you may need to add `C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin` to `%PATH%`

### Debugging (with VSCode)

If you don't have a preferred editor for Go code, we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

Launch and debug:

1. Open VSCode in either `cli/azd` (preferred) or in the root directory.
1. In VSCode, put a breakpoint on the line of code you would like to debug.
1. Press F5. Alternatively: Select the "Run and Debug" side pane. With the launch task set to "Debug azd cli", click on the launch button.
1. An interactive VSCode prompt should appear. Provide the args for running `azd` in this prompt window. Press enter when you're done.
1. `azd` should now be running inside the VSCode terminal with the debugger attached.

Launch `azd` separately, then attach:

1. Set `AZD_DEBUG=true` in your shell. If this environment variable is set, `azd` will pause early in its startup process and allow you to attach to it.
1. In VSCode, run the launch task "Attach to process".
1. Select `azd` and press enter.
1. VSCode debugger should now be attached to the running `azd` process.
1. In the shell with `azd` running, press enter to resume execution.

> Tip: Use the VSCode terminal to perform all `azd` build and run commands.

## Submitting a change

1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
1. Make your change, add tests, and ensure tests pass
1. Submit a pull request: `gh pr create --web` (install [gh cli][gh cli] if needed). Select "Create a fork" to set up a fork for the first time if prompted for.

## Troubleshooting

### Access is denied

Windows Security may block execution of unsigned .exe files. This may happen when validating unsigned .exe files produced in
a PR build.

```bash
> azd version
Access is denied.
```

To fix:

1. Run `where azd` (cmd) or `(Get-Command azd).Source` (PowerShell) to get the command path
1. Click the Start button and type `Windows Security`, select and launch the "Windows Security" application
1. Select `Virus & threat protection` tab on the left side of the window
1. Click the `Manage settings` link under `Virus & threat protection settings`
1. Scroll down in the window to the `Exclusions` heading and click the `Add or remove exclusions link`
1. Select `Add an exclusion` and add the path to the exe from step 1
