Manage your application environments. With this command group, you can create a new environment or get, set, and list your application environments.

  • An Application can have multiple environments (ex: dev, test, prod).
  • Each environment may have a different configuration (that is, connectivity information) for accessing Azure resources.
  • You can find all environment configuration under the .azure/<environment-name> folder.
  • The environment name is stored as the AZURE_ENV_NAME environment variable in the .azure/<environment-name>/.env file.
