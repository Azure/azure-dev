Provision the Azure resources for an application. This step may take a while depending on the resources provisioned. You should run azd provision any time you update your Bicep or Terraform file.

This command prompts you to input the following:

  • Azure location: The Azure location where your resources will be deployed.
  • Azure subscription: The Azure subscription where your resources will be deployed.

When <layer> is specified, only provisions resources for the given layer. When omitted, provisions resources for all layers defined in the project.

Usage
  azd provision [<layer>] [flags]

Flags
    -e, --environment string  	: The name of the environment to use.
