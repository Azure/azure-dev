Runs a workflow to package, provision and deploy your application in a single step.

The up workflow can be customized by adding a workflows section to your azure.yaml.

For example, modify the workflow to provision before packaging and deploying:

-------------------------
# azure.yaml
workflows:
  up:
    - azd: provision
    - azd: package --all
    - azd: deploy --all
-------------------------

Any azd command and flags are supported in the workflow steps.

Usage
