Runs a workflow to package, provision and deploy your application in a single step.

Before running, configure your target subscription and location:

  azd env set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID <your-subscription-id>
  azd env set AZURE_LOCATION <location>

Unlike Azure CLI, azd typically stores configuration such as subscription and location in a named environment.
You can still provide these values with flags on commands that support them, but azd env set persists them so you
don't need to pass them on every command. Commands like azd up read from the active environment automatically.
Use --output json for structured output suitable for automation.

The up workflow can be customized by adding a workflows section to your azure.yaml.

For example, modify the workflow to provision before packaging and deploying:

-------------------------
# azure.yaml
workflows:
  up:
    - azd: provision
    - azd: package --all
    - azd: deploy --all
-------------------------

Any azd command and flags are supported in the workflow steps.
