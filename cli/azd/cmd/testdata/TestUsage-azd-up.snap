Runs a workflow to package, provision and deploy your application in a single step.

The up workflow can be customized by adding a workflows section to your azure.yaml.

For example, modify the workflow to provision before packaging and deploying:

-------------------------
# azure.yaml
workflows:
  up:
    - azd: provision
    - azd: package --all
    - azd: deploy --all
-------------------------

Any azd command and flags are supported in the workflow steps.

Usage
  azd up [flags]

Flags
    -e, --environment string 	: The name of the environment to use.

Global Flags
    -C, --cwd string 	: Sets the current working directory.
        --debug      	: Enables debugging and diagnostics logging.
        --docs       	: Opens the documentation for azd up in your web browser.
    -h, --help       	: Gets help for up.
