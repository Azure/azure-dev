Runs a workflow to package, provision and deploy your application in a single step.

Before running, configure your target subscription and location:

  azd env set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID <your-subscription-id>
  azd env set AZURE_LOCATION <location>

Unlike Azure CLI, azd stores configuration in a named environment rather than
passing them as flags. Use azd env set to configure these values, then commands
like azd up read from that environment automatically.
Use --output json for structured output suitable for automation.

The up workflow can be customized by adding a workflows section to your azure.yaml.

For example, modify the workflow to provision before packaging and deploying:

-------------------------
# azure.yaml
workflows:
  up:
    - azd: provision
    - azd: package --all
    - azd: deploy --all
-------------------------

Any azd command and flags are supported in the workflow steps.

Usage
  azd up [flags]

    -e, --environment string 	: The name of the environment to use.

Global Flags
    -C, --cwd string 	: Sets the current working directory.
