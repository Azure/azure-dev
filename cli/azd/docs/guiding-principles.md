# Command Structure Design Principles for `azd`

## Overview

The Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) follows a systematic approach to command structure design that ensures discoverability, consistency, and extensibility across all features and future enhancements. These principles provide a foundation for building any new functionality while maintaining user familiarity and operational efficiency.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. **Verb-First Command Structure**

- Keep verb selection minimal to avoid user confusion: `up`, `add`, `deploy`
- Use simple, common words that users already understand
- Each command group should deal with one type of object to maintain clarity

### 2. **Build on Existing Foundations**

- Leverage established `azd verbs` rather than creating parallel command structures
- Extend existing workflows to accommodate new functionality
- Maintain backward compatibility with current usage patterns
- Avoid verb duplication; build on core verbs instead of creating new ones

### 3. **Progressive Disclosure**

- Basic commands work simply, advanced features are available when needed
- Users should naturally discover advanced capabilities within familiar command flows
- Maintain graceful degradation when advanced features are unavailable

### 4. **Consistency Across All Operations**

- Maintain consistent parameter patterns across similar commands
- Use established naming conventions and flag structures
- Ensure similar operations follow similar command patterns

## Command Structure Framework

### Primary Command Categories

#### **View** (Information & Status)

- Purpose: Display current state, configuration, and system information
- Examples: `list`, `show`, `version`
- Principle: Read-only operations that help users understand current state

#### **Edit** (Configuration & Management)

- Purpose: Modify configuration, manage resources, and setup operations
- Examples: `set`, `reset`, `unset`, `config`, `refresh`, `select`, `add`, `remove`, `install`, `uninstall`, `new`
- Principle: Operations that change system state or configuration

#### **Run** (Actions & Operations)

- Purpose: Execute workflows, deploy resources, and perform active operations
- Examples: `up`, `down`, `init`, `package`, `provision`, `deploy`, `run`
- Principle: Operations that perform work or execute processes

#### **Other** (Specialized Operations)

- Purpose: Specialized tasks that don't fit standard categories
- Examples: `restore`, `monitor`, `generate`, `login`, `logout`
- Principle: Unique operations specific to particular workflows

## Design Guidelines for Extensions

### 1. **Command Integration Strategy**

- New functionality should extend existing command categories
- Use subcommands and parameters rather than new top-level verbs
- Example: `azd add <new-resource-type>` instead of `azd <new-resource-type> add`

### 2. **Parameter and Flag Consistency**

- Reuse established parameter patterns across new commands
- Maintain consistent naming conventions (e.g., `--subscription`, `--name`, `--type`)
- Provide sensible defaults to reduce cognitive load

### 3. **Help and Discoverability**

- Integrate new functionality into existing `azd help` structure
- Provide contextual guidance within established command flows
- Maintain documentation consistency across core and extended features

### 4. **Template and Resource Integration**

- Leverage existing template system for new resource types
- Follow established template discovery and management patterns
- Integrate new resources into azd's resource lifecycle management

## Implementation Benefits

- **User Familiarity**: Builds on known command patterns and reduces learning curve
- **Discoverability**: New capabilities are found through existing workflows
- **Consistency**: Predictable behavior across all azd commands and extensions
- **Maintainability**: Systematic approach reduces complexity and technical debt
- **Extensibility**: Clear framework for adding capabilities without breaking existing patterns
- **Ecosystem Growth**: Provides foundation for third-party extensions and integrations

## Future Considerations

This framework enables:

- Advanced workflow automation
- Enhanced developer productivity features
- Consistent user experience across all `azd` functionality
- Integration of new Azure services and capabilities
- Third-party extension development
