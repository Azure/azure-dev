# Foundry Projects

Manage Microsoft Foundry Project resources from your terminal. (Preview)

See the shared [AI extension non-interactive input reference](../ai-non-interactive.md)
for every prompt's flag, environment/configuration input, or deterministic
no-prompt behavior.

## `azure.yaml` ownership

This extension owns `host: azure.ai.project` services and the `microsoft.foundry` provisioning provider. A project service carries account-level settings such as an existing project endpoint, model deployments, and private networking.

```yaml
infra:
  provider: microsoft.foundry

services:
  my-project:
    host: azure.ai.project
    endpoint: https://my-account.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/my-project
    deployments:
      - name: gpt-4.1-mini
        model:
          format: OpenAI
          name: gpt-4.1-mini
          version: "2025-04-14"
        sku:
          name: GlobalStandard
          capacity: 50
```

When `endpoint` is omitted, `azd provision` creates a Foundry account and project. When it is set, provisioning reuses that project and reconciles the declarations that can be applied to an existing account.

To reconcile deployments or a pending container registry on an existing project, set the project's full ARM resource ID in the active azd environment:

```sh
azd env set AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ID "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/<account>/projects/<project>"
```

`azd ai agent init` sets this value when initialized against an existing project. An endpoint-only service with no resources to reconcile does not require it.

Split `host: azure.ai.connection` services are reconciled during deploy by the
`azure.ai.connections` extension, never by Project provisioning. This applies
to embedded templates and newly ejected Bicep/Terraform alike. Project synthesis
does not read Connection or Toolbox payloads, environments, or credentials.
The system ACR connection used by the Project's registry remains Project-owned.

### Breaking migration

Upgrade the related Foundry extensions together. Older on-disk Bicep with generic
Connection modules/resources or `connections` / `connectionCredentials`
parameters is rejected with migration guidance. Remove those declarations and
their aggregate readiness outputs, or regenerate the IaC after saving custom
changes. Update previously ejected Terraform manually as well, including any
required state handoff to avoid destroying resources when removing declarations.
Extension upgrades do not automatically rewrite user-owned IaC.

Declare Connections and Toolboxes as independent services, keep Agent `uses`
dependencies, and run `azd deploy --all` after provisioning the Project. See the
[Connections migration guide](../azure.ai.connections/README.md#breaking-migration).

When provisioning reports insufficient Cognitive Services quota, check usage for the target region with
`az cognitiveservices usage list --location <region>` or request a quota increase in the Azure portal. If an
existing Foundry project should be reused instead, configure its endpoint and set `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ID` to the
full project resource ID before retrying.

The `azd ai project set`, `show`, and `unset` commands manage the default Foundry project endpoint context. They do not currently author the project service in `azure.yaml`.
