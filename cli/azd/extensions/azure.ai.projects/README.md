## Extension telemetry API

Extension code can report best-effort usage events through
`internal/telemetry`:

```go
reporter := telemetry.NewReporter(azdClient.Telemetry(), nil)
reporter.Report(ctx, telemetry.Event{
  Name: "project.operation.completed",
  Attributes: map[string]string{
    "operation": "provision",
  },
})
```

The example is illustrative; this extension does not currently emit a product
usage event through this interface. Existing provisioning span attributes are
unchanged by this adapter. Add an event only after its product question, bounded
values, documentation, and privacy review are agreed.

`Report` has no return value and never changes command or provider behavior. It
uses a one-second timeout, does not retry, and does not log attribute values or
transport error details. Put approved event builders and finite-value types in
`internal/telemetry/events.go`; do not call `ReportUsage` directly from command,
service-target, or provisioning code. Never include project endpoints, ARM IDs,
deployment names, resource names, paths, URLs, or other customer content. The azd
host records events only for extensions installed from the official registry.

## `azure.yaml` ownership

This extension owns `host: azure.ai.project` services and the `microsoft.foundry` provisioning provider. A project service carries account-level settings such as an existing project endpoint, model deployments, and private networking.

```yaml
infra:
  provider: microsoft.foundry

services:
  my-project:
    host: azure.ai.project
    endpoint: https://my-account.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/my-project
    deployments:
      - name: gpt-4.1-mini
        model:
          format: OpenAI
          name: gpt-4.1-mini
          version: "2025-04-14"
        sku:
          name: GlobalStandard
          capacity: 50
```

When `endpoint` is omitted, `azd provision` creates a Foundry account and project. When it is set, provisioning reuses that project and reconciles the declarations that can be applied to an existing account.

To reconcile deployments, connections, or a pending container registry on an existing project, set the project's full ARM resource ID in the active azd environment:

```sh
azd env set AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ID "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/<account>/projects/<project>"
```

`azd ai agent init` sets this value when initialized against an existing project. An endpoint-only service with no resources to reconcile does not require it.

When provisioning reports insufficient Cognitive Services quota, check usage for the target region with
`az cognitiveservices usage list --location <region>` or request a quota increase in the Azure portal. If an
existing Foundry project should be reused instead, configure its endpoint and set `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ID` to the
full project resource ID before retrying.

The `azd ai project set`, `show`, and `unset` commands manage the default Foundry project endpoint context. They do not currently author the project service in `azure.yaml`.
