# Foundry Routines

Manage Microsoft Foundry Routines from your terminal. (Preview)

## Timeout configuration

Routine read API calls default to a 30-second HTTP request timeout.
Routine write API calls default to a two-minute timeout to allow cold
recurring routine creates to finish AgentIdentity binding. Override both
defaults with the root `--timeout` flag, using Go duration syntax:

```bash
azd ai routine --timeout 3m create my-routine ...
```

Set `AZURE_AI_ROUTINES_HTTP_TIMEOUT` to apply the same override when
the extension runs without command flags, such as during `azd deploy`
service target upserts. The `--timeout` flag wins when both are
provided.
