# Release History

## Unreleased

### Features Added

- The `azure.ai.toolboxes` extension now registers an `azure.ai.toolbox` service-target host. `azd deploy`/`azd up` upsert each `host: azure.ai.toolbox` service in `azure.yaml` as a new toolbox version, resolving named `connection` references to their project connection IDs, expanding `${VAR}` references, and publishing the toolbox MCP endpoint to the azd environment.

## 0.1.1-preview (2026-06-19)

### Features

- [[#8672]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/issues/8672) `azd ai toolbox create` now writes the new toolbox's versioned MCP endpoint to the active azd environment under the `TOOLBOX_<NORMALIZED_NAME>_MCP_ENDPOINT` variable (the same key agents consume), and `azd ai toolbox delete` clears it when the whole toolbox is removed.

### Bugs Fixed

- [[#8688]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/issues/8688) Resolve the project endpoint that `azd ai agent init` stores. `azd ai toolbox` commands now fall back to `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` (after `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`) in both the active azd environment and the host environment, so the hosted-agent + toolbox workflow no longer fails with "no Foundry project endpoint resolved" after init.
