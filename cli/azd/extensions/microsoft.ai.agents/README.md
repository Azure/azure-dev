# Azure Developer CLI (azd) Agents Extension

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

1. **Enable extensions** (if not already enabled):
   ```bash
   azd config set alpha.extensions on
   ```

2. **Install developer kit extension** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   azd ext install microsoft.azd.extensions
   ```

   > **Note**: If you encounter an error about the extension not being in the registry, verify you have the default source configured:
   > ```bash
   > azd ext source list
   > ```
   > If missing, add it:
   > ```bash
   > azd ext source add -n azd -t url -l "https://aka.ms/azd/extensions/registry"
   > ```

### Building and Installing

1. **Navigate to the extension directory**:
   ```bash
   cd cli/azd/extensions/microsoft.ai.agents
   ```

2. **Initial setup** (first time only):
   ```bash
   azd x build
   azd x pack
   azd x publish
   ```

   > **Troubleshooting**: If `azd x publish` fails with "(Failed to load registry)":
   > 1. Create the registry file (needs to be valid JSON):
   >    ```bash
   >    echo '{}' > ~/.azd/registry.json
   >    ```
   > 2. Add the local registry as a source:
   >    ```bash
   >    azd ext source add -n local -l registry.json -t file
   >    ```
   > 3. Retry the publish command:
   >    ```bash
   >    azd x publish
   >    ```

3. **Install the extension**:
   ```bash
   azd ext install microsoft.ai.agents
   ```

4. **For subsequent development** (after initial setup):
   ```bash
   azd x watch
   ```
   This automatically watches for file changes, rebuilds, and installs updates locally.

   Or for manual builds:
   ```bash
   azd x build
   ```
   This builds and automatically installs the updated extension.

> [!NOTE]
> The `pack` and `publish` steps are only required for the first time setup. For ongoing development, `azd x watch` or `azd x build` handles all updates automatically.
