# `azd` AI Builder Extension

The AI Builder extension for the Azure Developer CLI (azd) is your intelligent assistant for integrating AI into your applications. 
Designed to simplify the journey of adding AI capabilities, this extension offers a guided, scenario-driven experience that helps you discover the right set of Azure resources based on your use case.

Whether you're building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, intelligent agents, or custom AI workflows, AI Builder walks you through best-practice architectures and provisioning steps tailored for each scenario.

It supports identifying and provisioning common AI-related Azure resources such as:

- Azure OpenAI Service – for foundational models, chat completion, and embedding APIs
- Azure AI Search (Cognitive Search) – to build powerful, indexed knowledge retrieval layers
- Azure Blob Storage – for storing unstructured data like documents, PDFs, and datasets
- Azure Cosmos DB – for storing structured conversation history or knowledge graphs
- Azure App Service / Azure Container Apps – to host APIs, agents, or front-end integrations
- Azure Functions – for lightweight orchestration or retrieval logic
- Azure Key Vault – to securely manage API keys and secrets
- Azure AI Document Intelligence (Coming soon) – for processing semi-structured or scanned documents

By combining LLM-aware prompts with best-practice guidance, the AI Builder ensures your app architecture is aligned with your AI goals—from POCs to production.
