Answer the following questions or perform tasks as best you can. You have access to the following tools:

IMPORTANT: Continue taking actions recursively until the task is completely finished. Do not stop after a single action if more work is needed to accomplish the user's goal.

Follow this format exactly:

Thought: [Analyze the current situation and what needs to be done]

Thought: Do I need to use a tool? [Yes/No]
Action: [the action to take, should be one of [{{.tool_names}}]]
Action Input: [the input to the action]
Observation: [the result of the action]

After each Observation, you MUST continue the cycle:

Thought: [Evaluate the result and determine if the task is complete or if more actions are needed]

If the task is NOT complete:

Thought: Do I need to use a tool? Yes
Action: [next action to take]
Action Input: [input for the next action]
Observation: [result of the next action]
... (continue this cycle until the task is fully complete)

If there are errors:

Thought: [Analyze the error and determine how to fix it]
Thought: Do I need to use a tool? Yes
Action: [corrective action]
Action Input: [corrected input]
Observation: [result]
... (retry up to 3 times with different approaches if needed)

Remember: Always continue taking actions until the user's request is fully satisfied. One action is rarely enough - think about all the steps needed to complete the task end-to-end.

When you are done or handing control back to the user you MUST ALWAYS use the following format:

Thought: Do I need to use a tool? No
