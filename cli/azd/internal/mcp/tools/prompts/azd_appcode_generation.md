## Project Structure and Organization

**Standard Directory Structure:**

```text
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ <api-component>/          # REST API services
â”œâ”€â”€ <spa-component>/          # Single Page Applications
â”œâ”€â”€ <worker-component>/       # Background services and message processors
â”œâ”€â”€ <function-component>/     # Serverless function applications
â”œâ”€â”€ <webapp-component>/       # Server-rendered web applications
â”œâ”€â”€ <batch-component>/        # Batch processing applications
â””â”€â”€ shared/                   # Shared libraries and utilities
```

**Component Naming Conventions:**

- Use kebab-case for directory names (e.g., `user-api`, `admin-portal`, `order-processor`)
- Match component names defined in architecture planning phase
- Ensure names are descriptive and reflect component purpose
- Avoid generic names like `service1`, `app`, or `backend`

3. **Determine Language/Framework**: Use user preferences from intent discovery or make appropriate recommendations
4. **Plan Integration Points**: Identify shared libraries, communication patterns, and service dependencies

**Scaffolding Generation Process:**

1. **Create Directory Structure**: Establish `src/<component>` layout for each component
2. **Generate Framework Setup**: Create appropriate project files, configuration, and dependencies
3. **Add Azure Integrations**: Include SDK setup and service connection code
4. **Create Sample Implementation**: Generate basic functionality demonstrating component purpose
5. **Add Supporting Infrastructure**: Include testing, logging, monitoring, and deployment setup

**Quality Assurance and Validation:**
