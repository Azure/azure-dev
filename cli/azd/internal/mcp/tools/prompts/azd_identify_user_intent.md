âœ… **Agent Task List**  

1. Engage user with conversational questions to understand project purpose and stage
2. Determine application scale requirements and production readiness

ðŸ“„ **Required Outputs**  

- Project classification: POC, Development Tool, or Production Application
- Scale category: Small, Medium, or Large (for production applications)
- Budget constraint level: Cost-Optimized, Balanced, or Performance-Focused
- Architectural preference: Containers, Serverless, Hybrid, or No Preference
- Comprehensive requirements summary documented in Application specification

ðŸ§  **Execution Guidelines**  

**CRITICAL:** Ask questions conversationally, one at a time or in small groups. Adapt follow-up questions based on user responses. Don't overwhelm with a long questionnaire.

## Phase 1: Project Purpose and Stage Discovery

Start with foundational questions to understand the project's intent:

**Primary Questions:**

- "What's the main purpose of this application? Are you building a proof of concept, a development/internal tool, or planning for a production application?"
- "Who is the intended audience for this application?" (Internal team, external customers, specific user group)
- "What problem does this application solve?"

**Follow-up Questions (based on response):**

*If POC/Prototype:*

- "How long do you expect this proof of concept to run?"
- "Will this potentially evolve into a production application?"
- "Are you primarily focused on demonstrating functionality or testing performance?"

*If Development Tool:*

- "How many developers or users will be using this tool?"
- "Is this for temporary use or a long-term internal solution?"
- "Do you need high availability or is occasional downtime acceptable?"

*If Production Application:*

- Proceed to Phase 2 for detailed scale assessment

## Phase 2: Scale and Performance Requirements (Production Applications)

**User Base Questions:**

- "How many users do you expect when the application launches?"
- "What's your expected user growth over the next 12 months?"
- "Will usage be steady throughout the day or are there peak periods?"

**Geographic and Availability Questions:**

- "Will your users be primarily in one geographic region or globally distributed?"
- "What level of availability do you need? (e.g., 99.9%, 99.99%, or basic uptime)"
- "How critical is performance? Are sub-second response times required?"

**Scale Classification (Internal Use):**

- **Small Scale:** <10K users, single region, standard availability requirements
- **Medium Scale:** 10K-100K users, multi-region consideration, higher availability needs  
- **Large Scale:** >100K users, global distribution, enterprise-grade availability and performance

## Phase 3: Budget and Cost Considerations

**Budget Discovery Questions:**

- "Do you have specific budget constraints or cost targets for running this application?"
- "Is minimizing costs the top priority, or are you willing to invest more for better performance/reliability?"
- "Are you more concerned about predictable monthly costs or optimizing for the lowest possible spend?"

**Cost Preference Classification:**

- **Cost-Optimized:** Minimize expenses, accept some performance trade-offs, prefer consumption-based pricing
- **Balanced:** Reasonable cost with good performance, mix of reserved and consumption pricing
- **Performance-Focused:** Cost is secondary to performance and reliability, premium services acceptable

## Phase 4: Architectural and Stack Preferences

**Technology Approach Questions:**

- "Do you have experience with containers (Docker) or prefer to avoid container management?"
- "Are you interested in serverless approaches where you don't manage infrastructure?"
- "Do you need full control over the underlying infrastructure, or prefer managed services?"
- "Are there specific technologies or platforms you want to use or avoid?"

**Programming Language and Framework Preferences:**

- "What programming language does your team prefer or have the most experience with?" (JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, C#, Java, Go, or other)
- "Do you have preferences for specific frameworks?" (React, Angular, Vue for frontend; Express, FastAPI, Spring Boot for backend)
- "Are there any technology constraints from your organization or existing systems?"
- "Do you prefer strongly-typed languages or are you comfortable with dynamic typing?"

**Integration and Compliance Questions:**

- "Do you need to integrate with existing systems or databases?"
- "Are there any compliance requirements (HIPAA, SOC2, etc.) that influence your architecture choices?"
- "Do you have existing Azure services or subscriptions this should connect to?"

**Architectural Preference Classification:**

- **Containers:** Prefer containerized applications with orchestration (Azure Container Apps, AKS)
- **Serverless:** Prefer event-driven, fully managed compute (Azure Functions, Logic Apps)
- **Hybrid:** Mix of containers and serverless based on component needs
- **No Preference:** Open to recommendations based on best fit for requirements

**Technology Stack Preferences:**

- **Programming Language:** [JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, C#, Java, Go, Other]
- **Frontend Framework:** [React, Angular, Vue.js, No Preference, Other]
- **Backend Framework:** [Express/Node.js, FastAPI/Flask, ASP.NET Core, Spring Boot, No Preference, Other]
- **Database Preference:** [SQL-based, NoSQL, No Preference, Existing System Integration]

## Phase 5: Requirements Documentation

Create or update Application specification with a "Project Requirements" section containing:

```markdown
## Project Requirements

### Project Classification
- **Type:** [POC/Development Tool/Production Application]
- **Primary Purpose:** [Brief description]
- **Target Audience:** [Description of users]

### Scale Requirements
- **User Base:** [Expected users and growth]
- **Geographic Scope:** [Single region/Multi-region/Global]
- **Availability Needs:** [Uptime requirements]
- **Scale Category:** [Small/Medium/Large - for production apps]

### Budget Considerations
- **Cost Priority:** [Cost-Optimized/Balanced/Performance-Focused]
- **Budget Constraints:** [Any specific limitations mentioned]
- **Pricing Preference:** [Consumption vs Reserved vs Hybrid]

### Architectural Preferences
- **Stack Preference:** [Containers/Serverless/Hybrid/No Preference]
- **Programming Language:** [Preferred language and rationale]
- **Frontend Framework:** [Chosen framework if applicable]
- **Backend Framework:** [Chosen framework if applicable]
- **Infrastructure Control:** [Managed services vs Infrastructure control preference]
- **Integration Requirements:** [Existing systems to connect with]
- **Compliance Requirements:** [Any mentioned compliance needs]

### Key Insights
- [Any additional context that influences architecture decisions]
- [Special requirements or constraints mentioned]
```

**Conversation Flow Tips:**

- Start with open-ended questions and narrow down based on responses
- If user is unsure about technical terms, provide brief explanations
- For POCs, focus more on timeline and potential evolution rather than scale
- For production apps, spend more time on scale and reliability requirements
- Always ask "Is there anything else about your requirements I should know?" at the end
- Keep the tone consultative and helpful, not interrogative
