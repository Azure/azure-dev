# AZD Project Intent and Requirements Discovery Instructions

**TASK:** Engage users with conversational questions to understand project purpose, scale requirements, budget constraints, and architectural preferences, then classify and document findings.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**

- Project classification determined (POC, Development Tool, or Production Application)
- Scale category identified for production applications (Small, Medium, or Large)
- Budget constraint level established (Cost-Optimized, Balanced, or Performance-Focused)
- Architectural preference documented (Containers, Serverless, Hybrid, or No Preference)
- Comprehensive requirements summary documented in application specification

**VALIDATION REQUIRED:**

- All critical requirements gathered through conversational questions
- Project classification aligns with user responses about purpose and audience
- Scale and budget preferences are clearly documented
- Technology and architectural preferences are captured
- Requirements are properly documented in application specification

**COMPLETION CHECKLIST:**

- [ ] Engage user with conversational questions about project purpose and stage
- [ ] Determine application scale requirements and production readiness
- [ ] Identify budget and cost constraint considerations
- [ ] Understand architectural and technology stack preferences
- [ ] Classify project into appropriate categories
- [ ] Document findings in application specification under "Project Requirements"

## Critical Discovery Questions

**Project Purpose and Stage:**

- Main purpose of the application and intended audience
- Project stage (POC/prototype, development tool, or production application)
- Problem the application solves and success criteria

**Scale and Performance (Production Applications):**

- Expected user base at launch and growth projections
- Geographic distribution and availability requirements
- Performance criticality and response time needs

**Budget and Cost Considerations:**

- Budget constraints and cost targets
- Priority between cost optimization vs performance
- Preference for predictable vs consumption-based pricing

**Architectural and Technology Preferences:**

- Team experience with containers, serverless, or infrastructure management
- Programming language and framework preferences
- Technology constraints from organization or existing systems
- Control vs managed services preference
