# AZD New Project Creation Orchestration Instructions

**TASK:** Orchestrate complete new project creation from scratch through requirements discovery, stack selection, architecture planning, and file generation guidance to create a ready-to-implement project specification.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**

- Complete application specification document created with all project details
- Technology stack recommendation provided with clear rationale
- Azure service architecture design completed with component mappings
- File generation roadmap established for implementation phase
- Project specification serves as blueprint for deployment

**VALIDATION REQUIRED:**

- All project requirements gathered through systematic discovery process
- Stack selection aligns with team expertise and project characteristics
- Architecture design supports identified requirements and constraints
- Project specification is comprehensive and implementation-ready
- Validation checklist confirms project readiness

**COMPLETION CHECKLIST:**

- [ ] Welcome user and confirm new project creation intent
- [ ] Conduct user intent discovery for project requirements and constraints
- [ ] Perform stack selection process to determine optimal technology approach
- [ ] Conduct architecture planning for Azure service mappings and infrastructure
- [ ] Document comprehensive project specification
- [ ] Provide file generation guidance and next steps for implementation
- [ ] Run full AZD project validation and address all errors
- [ ] Ensure project specification is complete and up-to-date

## Critical Creation Process

**Project Initiation:**

- Confirm new project creation (no existing code or infrastructure)
- Verify user wants AZD compatible Azure project
- Explain systematic discovery and planning process
- Create new application specification for documentation

**Requirements Discovery Phase:**

- Project purpose and classification (POC, Development Tool, Production Application)
- Expected scale and user base requirements
- Budget and cost considerations
- Performance and availability expectations
- Timeline and deployment urgency

**Stack Selection Phase:**

- Team technical expertise and preferences
- Application characteristics and complexity requirements
- Performance and scalability needs
- Integration and workflow requirements

**Architecture Planning Phase:**

- Application component breakdown and relationships
- Azure service mappings based on stack selection
- Infrastructure and deployment strategy
- Implementation roadmap and next steps
