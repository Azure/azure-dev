// serverSession represents a logical connection from a single client. Since our RPCs are split over multiple HTTP endpoints,
// we need a way to correlate these multiple connections together. This is the purpose of the session. Sessions are assigned
// a unique ID when they are created and are stored in the sessions map. The serverSession object holds a container (created
// via NewScope from the root container the server uses) as well as a few other bits of state. Since our RPCs run
// asynchronously, multiple RPCs can be running concurrently on the same session. This means that the serverSession object
// needs to be safe to access from multiple goroutines. sessionMu is used to protect access to the session itself.
//
// TODO(azure/azure-dev#3287): Today we lock the session at the start of each RPC and hold it for the entire lifetime of the
// RPC. In practice this can be problematic because DeployAsync and RefreshEnvironmentAsync can take a long time to run.
// Ideally we would do finer grained locking the session itself and know that the rest of the system is safe to run
// concurrently. To do this we need to get better disciplined about what state we store and how we access it, so for now
// we just do very coarse grained locking.
