        Version prints the build information for Go binary files.

        Go version reports the Go version used to build each of the named files.

        If no files are named on the command line, go version prints its own
        version information.

        If a directory is named, go version walks that directory, recursively,
        looking for recognized Go binaries and reporting their versions.
        By default, go version does not report unrecognized files found
        during a directory scan. The -v flag causes it to report unrecognized files.

        The -m flag causes go version to print each file's embedded
        module version information, when available. In the output, the module
        information consists of multiple lines following the version line, each
        indented by a leading tab character.
