# Evals quick start

This folder contains a small Vally eval example for the Azure Developer CLI repo.

## Run locally

From this folder, install dependencies and run the eval:

```bash
# assuming node v24+
npm ci

# see below for various run scripts you can use to try out different evals, or try them all
# at once!
```

## Targets

NOTE: the evals are a first pass, so you will see them fail - things have yet to be tuned.

Each eval definition targets a different azd scenario. Run them via npm:

| Command                     | Targets                                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run eval:simple`       | `eval.yaml` — starter example showing Vally features (fixtures, worktrees)                   |
| `npm run eval:troubleshoot` | `eval-azd-troubleshooting.yaml` — asking the LLM about azd, but without any files (pure Q&A) |
| `npm run eval:deploy`       | `eval-azd-deploy.yaml` — does the model suggest azd for an app + Azure, skill loaded         |
| `npm run eval:experiment`   | `eval-azd.experiments.yaml` — skills on/off baseline (see the file header)                   |
| `npm run report`            | generates a simple report from latest eval and experiment runs                               |

## Main folders

Each Vally evaluation is controlled by its own `eval-*.yaml`. The structure for
everything else is up to us:

```text
evals/
├── eval.yaml                     # starter example (npm run eval:simple)
├── eval-azd-qna.yaml             # Q&A / error scenarios
├── eval-azd-deploy.yaml          # deploy + environment scenarios
├── eval-azd.experiments.yaml     # skills on/off experiment
├── fixtures/                     # input files mounted into eval worktrees
├── graders/                      # custom grader logic
├── skills/azd/                   # the azd skill injected during evals
├── make-vally-report.go          # report generator (npm run report)
|  # these are output folders from vally itself. They're just JSON/JSONL files, so you can parse
|  # them yourself, or just use make-vally-report.go as a starting point.
|  #
├── vally-results/                # output from local eval runs
└── vally-experiment-results/     # output from local experiment runs
```
