## Next Steps

### Provision infrastructure and deploy application code

Run `azd up` to provision your infrastructure and deploy to Azure (or run `azd provision` then `azd deploy` to accomplish the tasks separately). Visit the service endpoints listed to see your application up-and-running!

To troubleshoot any issues, see [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

### Configure environment variables for running services

Environment variables can be configured by modifying the `env` settings in [resources.bicep](./infra/resources.bicep).
To define a secret, add the variable as a `secretRef` pointing to a `secrets` entry or a stored KeyVault secret.

### Configure CI/CD pipeline

Run `azd pipeline config` to configure the deployment pipeline to connect securely to Azure. 

- Deploying with `GitHub Actions`: Select `GitHub` when prompted for a provider. If your project lacks the `azure-dev.yml` file, accept the prompt to add it and proceed with pipeline configuration.

- Deploying with `Azure DevOps Pipeline`: Select `Azure DevOps` when prompted for a provider. If your project lacks the `azure-dev.yml` file, accept the prompt to add it and proceed with pipeline configuration.

## What was added

### Infrastructure configuration

To describe the infrastructure and application, `azure.yaml` along with Infrastructure as Code files using Bicep were added with the following directory structure:

```yaml
- azure.yaml        # azd project configuration
- infra/            # Infrastructure-as-code Bicep files
  - main.bicep      # Subscription level resources
  - resources.bicep # Primary resource group resources
  - modules/        # Library modules
```

The resources declared in [resources.bicep](./infra/resources.bicep) are provisioned when running `azd up` or `azd provision`.
This includes:


- Azure Container App to host the 'llama-index-javascript' service.

### Build from source (no Dockerfile)

#### Build with Buildpacks using Oryx

If your project does not contain a Dockerfile, we will use [Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/) using [Oryx](https://github.com/microsoft/Oryx/blob/main/doc/README.md) to create an image for the services in `azure.yaml` and get your containerized app onto Azure.

To produce and run the docker image locally:

1. Run `azd package` to build the image.
2. Copy the *Image Tag* shown.
3. Run `docker run -it <Image Tag>` to run the image locally.

#### Exposed port

Oryx will automatically set `PORT` to a default value of `80` (port `8080` for Java). Additionally, it will auto-configure supported web servers such as `gunicorn` and `ASP .NET Core` to listen to the target `PORT`. If your application already listens to the port specified by the `PORT` variable, the application will work out-of-the-box. Otherwise, you may need to perform one of the steps below:

1. Update your application code or configuration to listen to the port specified by the `PORT` variable
1. (Alternatively) Search for `targetPort` in a .bicep file under the `infra/app` folder, and update the variable to match the port used by the application.

## Billing

Visit the *Cost Management + Billing* page in Azure Portal to track current spend. For more information about how you're billed, and how you can monitor the costs incurred in your Azure subscriptions, visit [billing overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/intro/azure-developer-billing).

## Troubleshooting

Q: I visited the service endpoint listed, and I'm seeing a blank page, a generic welcome page, or an error page.

A: Your service may have failed to start, or it may be missing some configuration settings. To investigate further:

1. Run `azd show`. Click on the link under "View in Azure Portal" to open the resource group in Azure Portal.
2. Navigate to the specific Container App service that is failing to deploy.
3. Click on the failing revision under "Revisions with Issues".
4. Review "Status details" for more information about the type of failure.
5. Observe the log outputs from Console log stream and System log stream to identify any errors.
6. If logs are written to disk, use *Console* in the navigation to connect to a shell within the running container.
