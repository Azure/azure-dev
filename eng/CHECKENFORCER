  # What is Check Enforcer?
  
  Check Enforcer helps ensure all pull requests are covered by at least one
  check-run (typically an Azure Pipeline). When all check-runs associated
  with this pull request pass then Check Enforcer itself will pass.
  
  # Why am I getting this message?
  
  You are getting this message because Check Enforcer did not detect any
  check-runs being associated with this pull request within five minutes. This
  may indicate that your pull request is not covered by any pipelines and so
  Check Enforcer is correctly blocking the pull request being merged.
  
  # What should I do now?
  
  If the **check-enforcer** check-run is not passing and all other check-runs
  associated with this PR are passing (excluding _license-cla_) then you could
  try telling _Check Enforcer_ to evaluate your pull request again. You can
  do this by adding a comment to this pull request as follows:
  
  ```
  /check-enforcer evaluate
  ```
  
  Typically evaulation only takes a few seconds. If you know that your pull
  request is not covered by a pipeline and this is expected you can override
  Check Enforcer using the following command:
  
  ```
  /check-enforcer override
  ```
