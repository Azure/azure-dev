# Azure Developer CLI (azd) Terraform Starter

A starter template with Terraform as infrastructure provider for Azure Developer CLI (azd).

The following assets have been provided:

- Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) files under the `infra` directory that demonstrate how to provision resources and setup resource tagging for `azd`.
- A dev container configuration file under the `.devcontainer` directory that installs python, Node.js, and infrastructure tools by default. This can be readily used to create cloud-hosted developer environments such as GitHub Codespaces.
- Continuous deployment workflows for CI providers such as GitHub Actions under the `.github` directory, and Azure Pipelines under the `.azdo` directory that work for most use-cases.
