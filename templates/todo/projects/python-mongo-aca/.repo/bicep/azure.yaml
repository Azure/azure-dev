      # This strategy workarounds the `azd up` order, where package is called before provision, and the image created by package is used by deploy.
      # If the tag is not static, calling package from a hook would produce a new unique image, which would be ignored by deploy.
      # For static-web-applications, package must happen after provision.

    hooks:
      # This hook creates a temporary `.env.local` file for the build command. Vite will automatically use it during docker image creation.
      # The values are mapped to the infrastructure outputs.
      # .env.local is ignored by git.
      # see: https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode
      # Note: dotenv must be a project dependency for this to work. See package.json.
      # Note: the docker/tag setting must be static (see above).
